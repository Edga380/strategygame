# Strategy game
Earth needs more resources to sustain mankind. After finding a planet with a lot of it they think their problems are solved. While building a new base 
on the planet and harvesting its resources they encounter a species that have been harvesting it too, so the fight for resources begins.

# Why did I choose this type of game?
I got inspired to develop this kind of game because when I was a little kid I went to my friend's house and he had new sega genesis 2 and a game called "Dune".
I loved to play that game so much that I spent hours playing it. Later on in my life I found out that there was a new version of this game on PC. I had to
try it out. After trying it I got hooked again and played it a lot. These days I don't play it that often anymore but that's the story on how I got the idea to make this type of game.

# Tips

    * Be quick at the beginning of the game.
    * First build "Harvest depot", second "Vehicle factory".
    * Follow your energy needs if energy usage is higher than available energy. You will not be able to 
    train soldiers or manufacture vehicles.
    * Protect your "Harvesters". The enemy can attack them at any time.
